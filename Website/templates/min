librosa - to convert .wav file to mel spectogram
pretty-midi -  to convert .midi to piano roll
midi- contains info about each audio played like json
sample rate = 16000 hertz - no. of samples per second
hop length = 512 gap between two overlapping sample windows in 1 frame
fft - 1 frame has = 2048 samples = 32 ms 
n_mels - spectorgram bin 229 mel bins
pithces- note
segemtn length = 480 frames
preporcessing
.wav to mespectro
midi to piano roll
total 4800 frames means 10 segments where 1 segment has 480 frames
1276 audio files in maestro v3 120gb

feature learning
cnn input = 480 x 229 .mel spectrogram
cnn output is feature map 480 x 768
its passed as input to bidirectional lstm - 128 units
output of lstm is passed to sigmoid layer to multilabel classification
cnn output - feature (map) extraction
lstm output - feature map(input of lstm is cnn output)
padding and trimming

for input to gcn
from piano roll, we make note activation (how many timees a note is pressed) , pearson correlation matrix (interdependency), optimal thershold (>threshold - add edge in graph from the nodes)

adjacency matrix is input of gcn (88 x88 matrix)
3 stacked layer gcn
focal loss prevents class imbalance (overfitting)


before reg-48 epochs
after reg- 88 epochs

focal loss prevents class imbalance by focussing on hard examples
l2 regularization prevents overfitting by penalties
